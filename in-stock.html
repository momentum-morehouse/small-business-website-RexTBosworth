        <h2>Wild Hyacinth</h2>
        <img src="starter_files/images/wild-hyacinth.jpg" alt="wild-hyacinth" height="150"><br> 
        This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. <br>
        The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. <br>
        It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky <br>
        outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally <br>
        it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. <br>
        The plants may be divided in autumn after the leaves <br>
        have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. <br>
        Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.
        
        <h2>Lily-of-the-Valley</h2>
        <img src="starter_files/images/lily-of-the-valley.jpg" alt="Lily-of-the-Valley" height="150"><br>
        With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that <br>
        dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof <br>
        shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the <br>
        pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, <br>
        and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to watch this perennial <br>
        to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well.<br>
        <strong>Warning: this plant is poisonous</strong>

        <h2>Crown imperials</h2>
        <img src="starter_files/images/crown-imperials.jpg" alt="crown-imperials" height="150"><br>
        Crown imperials are strong-growing bulbous plants, making rapid <br>
        growth in the spring, flowering during April/early May and dying <br>
        down in early summer. Best in raised beds or planters. Does not <br>
        tolerate shade; needs a warm, sunny position where it can be <br>
        left undisturbed for many years.

        <h2>Persian buttercup</h2>
        <img src="starter_files/images/persian-buttercup.jpg" alt="persian-buttercup" height="150"><br>
        This species of buttercup can get up to 2 feet tall and has large <br>
        showy blooms in a variety of colors from May to June. Persian <br>
        buttercups are most commonly grown from tubers planted in the <br>
        beginning of spring. Each plant will produce up to 70 blooms <br>
        in a season. Good for cooler weather; can tolerate light frost.

        <h2>Spring starflower</h2>
        <img src="starter_files/images/spring-starflower.jpg" alt="spring-starflower" height="150"><br>
        These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and <br>
        Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the <br>
        winter doldrums away. These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. <br>
        They can get up to half a foot tall with a similar spread. Each bulb <br>
        will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green <br>
        foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.

        <h2>Tulips</h2>
        <img src="starter_files/images/tulips.jpg" alt="tulips" height="150"><br>
        We have a wide variety of tulips in many colors. Plant tulip bulbs <br>
        in the fall, 6 to 8 weeks before a hard frost is expected and when <br>
        soils are below 60 degrees F.
